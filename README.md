# <span style = "color:#24446C">Enterprise Architecture | Architecture Decision Record (ADR)</span>

The following is a Proof of Concept (POC) for Intermountain Healtchare's Enterprise Architecture team to consider 
leveraging a repository to formally document decisions made as they pertain to the Intermountain Healthcare EA Metamodel.

For purposes of evaluation, two templates have been defined and can be found in the 'templates' file folder above.

### Template 1 Specs:
* Inspired by Michael Nygards Article: [Documenting Architecture Decisions](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
* Content Sections:
  * Title
  * Status
  * Context
  * Decision
  * Consequences
* Possibly an easier 'Phase 1' if the Architecture Team were interested in adopting a formal ADR-mechanism


### Template 2 Specs:
* Inspired by published article: [Architecture Decisions: Demystifying Architecture](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~chung/SA/zz-Impreso-architecture_decisions-tyree-05.pdf)
* Content Sections:
  * Issue
  * Decision
  * Status
  * Group
  * Assumptions
  * Constraints
  * Positions
  * Argument
  * Implications
  * Related Decisions
  * Related Requirements
  * Related Artifacts
  * Related Principles
  * Notes
* Template ensures decisions are rich with context, leading to greater referential value. However, would be a bigger 'lift' in terms of the commitment needed by the EA team to commit to this format of documenting decisions.
