# 1. Use of Mobile Application class type for Mobile Apps

_Date: 2022-12-05_

### Issue
***
There is not an established mechanism to classify mobile applications within the Intermountian Healthcare EA Metamodel.

Stakeholder has surfaced use case with following needs pertaining to managing Mobile Applications:
* Tracking security approval
* Tracking associated cost(s)
* Associating mobile applications with certain use cases and/or responsible owners
* Managing a centralized list of 'approved' Mobile Applications

### Decision
***
Mobile Application class type will be added to the EA Metamodel and used as the mechanism to store Mobile 
Application data.

### Status
***
Approved

### Group
***
Metamodel Class Types

### Assumptions
***
Clearly describe the underlying assumptions in the environment in which you're the making the decision -- cost, schedule, 
technology, and so on. Note that the environmental constraints (such as accepted technology standards, enterprise architecture, 
commonly employed patterns, and so on) might limit the alternatives you consider.

### Constraints
*** 
Capture any additional constraints to the environment that the chosen alternative (the decision) might pose.

### Positions
***
Lis the positions (viable options or alternatives) considered. These often require long explanations, sometimes even
models and diagrams. This isn't an exhaustive list. However, you don't want to hear the question "Did you think about...?"
during a final review; this leads to loss of credibility and questioning of other architectural decisions. This sections 
also helps ensure that options' of others were heard; explicitly stating other opinions helps enroll their advocacy in 
the decision. 

### Argument
***
Outline why the position was selected, including items such as implementation cost, total ownership cost, time to market, 
and required development resources' availability. This is probably as important as the decision itself.

### Implications
***
A decision comes with many implications, as the REMAP metamodel denotes. For example, a decision might introduce a 
need to make other decisions, create new requirements, or modify existing requirements; pose additional constraints to ]
the environment; require renegotiating scope or schedule with customers; or require additional staff training.
Clearly understanding and stating the implications of the decision will be very effective in gaining buy-in and creating 
a roadmap for architecture execution.

### Related Decisions
***
It's obvious that many decisions are related; these can be listed here. However, it has been found in practice, a 
traceability matrix, decision trees, or metamodels are more useful. Metamodel are useful for showing complex 
relationships diagrammatically (such as Rose models).

### Related Requirements
***
Decisions should be business driven. To show accountability, explicitly map your decisions to the objectivevs or 
requirements. You can enumerate these related requirements here, but it may be more convenient to reference a
traceability matrix. You can assess each architecture decision's contribution to meeting each requirement, and then assess
how well the requirement is met across all decisions. If a decision doesn't contribute to meeting a requirement, don't 
make that decision.

### Related Artifacts
***
List the related architecture, design, or scope documents that this decision impacts. 

### Related Principles
***
If the enterprise has an agreed-upon set of principles, make sure the decision is consistent with one or more of them. 
This helps ensure alignment along domains or systems.

### Notes
***
Because the decision-making process can take weeks, it may be useful to capture notes and issues that the team discusses
during the socialization process.
